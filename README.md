# C_File_Gestion
Project that was developed to offer the user 
complete file management within the Operating System (Linux). 
It was implemented and made possible thanks to the use of 
system calls that interact directly with the system itself. 
It offers the possibility of: 
- create files / folders 
-write inside a text file 
-read a text file and / or search for a specific word or number within it 
- remove files or folders - view the contents of folders. 
There are many .h and .c files that implement the corresponding .h files. 
It was necessary to create a part that manages all the controls, 
such as checking if the file / folder exists, checking if the folder 
inside it is empty or much more. Until we meet again.
Project developed in Group with : mensio @Sophiss.
